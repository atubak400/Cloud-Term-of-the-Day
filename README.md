# Cloud Terms for the Day

1. Dedicated Host

* A Dedicated Host in the cloud is like having your own special cloud computer server. It's only for you, so you don't have to share it with anyone else. This makes it super secure because no one else can mess with your stuff. Businesses that need extra security or have special rules to follow like using Dedicated Hosts. You can also change the computer to make it work better for what you need. It's like having your own computer space in the cloud!


2. AWS CodeDeploy 

* This is a fully-managed deployment service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies and automates the deployment process of applications to various computing resources, like Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises servers. AWS CodeDeploy is a fully-managed deployment service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It automates the process of deploying applications to a set of compute resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises servers. When you create new computer code or updates for your applications, CodeDeploy takes care of putting that code on your servers so that your apps can run smoothly. It's like having a reliable assistant that ensures your software changes happen without any hiccups, making the whole process of updating and managing your applications easier and more efficient. #ContinuousDeployment #DevOpsAutomation #DeploymentAutomation #CloudDeployment #AWSDevOps #ApplicationRelease  #InfrastructureAsCode #AWSDeployment #CodeDeployments# Cloud-Term-of-the-Day


3. CodeDeploy deployment State-change Notification. 

* This is a message that AWS CodeDeploy sends out whenever there is a change in the status of a deployment. This status could be things like whether the deployment was successful or if it encountered any issues (i.e a failure).


4. CloudFormation StackSet

* A CloudFormation StackSet is like a master blueprint in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you manage and deploy stacks (collections of AWS resources) across multiple accounts and regions. Instead of creating the same stack over and over for different parts of your business with Cloudformation Templates, a StackSet lets you do it all at once. It's like telling AWS, "Hey, deploy this setup everywhere I need it," and AWS takes care of the rest. This is super handy for keeping things consistent and efficient, especially when you're dealing with a lot of AWS accounts and regions. #CloudFormation #AWSManagement #InfrastructureAsCode #AWSStackSets #MultiRegionDeployment #InfrastructureManagement #CloudConsistency #AWSAutomation #CloudScale #DevOpsInAction #CrossAccountDeployment #AWSArchitecture #CloudEfficiency


5. AWS Organizations

* AWS Organizations is like a control center for managing multiple AWS accounts. It helps you keep everything organized, kind of like having folders for your accounts. With AWS Organizations, you can set policies for your accounts, control access, and manage billing in one central place. It's especially useful for businesses with different teams or projects, allowing them to structure their AWS environment efficiently. Think of it as the conductor orchestrating the harmony of your various AWS accounts. #AWSOrganizations #MultiAccountManagement #CloudGovernance #AWSBilling

6. AWS Organizational Unit

* An AWS Organizational Unit (OU) is like a folder within AWS Organizations, helping you group and organize accounts based on your business structure. It's like having separate sections for different teams or projects, making it easier to manage permissions and policies. With OUs, you can apply specific rules or settings to a bunch of accounts at once, streamlining the administration of your AWS environment. It's like putting your AWS accounts into neat categories for better control and efficiency. #AWSOU #OrganizationalUnit #AWSManagement #CloudOrganization


7. CloudFormation Change Set

* A CloudFormation Change Set is like a preview of changes you want to make to your AWS infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. It's like a sneak peek before you actually apply the changes. When you're about to update your stack (the collection of AWS resources), a Change Set shows you what's going to be added, modified, or removed. This is super handy because it lets you review and approve the changes before they happen, reducing the chance of unexpected surprises. Think of it as a safety net for your infrastructure changes in the AWS cloud. #CloudFormation #ChangeSet #AWSInfrastructureUpdate


8. Network Load Balancer (NLB) Security Groups

* Unlike Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers (NLBs) don't have direct associations with security groups. Instead, security groups are linked to the instances within the target groups that NLBs route traffic to. Each instance can have its own security group, and traffic is managed according to the rules specified in those security groups. This decentralization allows fine-grained control over the security of individual instances while benefiting from the high-performance capabilities of Network Load Balancers. #NLB #AWSLoadBalancing #SecurityGroups
